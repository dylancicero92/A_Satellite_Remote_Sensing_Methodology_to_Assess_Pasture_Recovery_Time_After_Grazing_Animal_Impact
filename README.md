# A Satellite Remote Sensing Methodology to Assess Pasture Recovery Time After Grazing Animal Impact

This study trials and assesses a methodology in which pasture recovery time after grazing animal impact 
could be predicted based on a set of relevant variables, including weather, soil condition, and grazing intensity. 
Satellite Images were acquired from the Planet PlanetScope constellation and processed in Google Earth Engine.
